1/11/21 - but of context for this project that I didnt add a readme

This was a colt steele project, he showed the finished result of this project, told us to make it without a code along, I tried it and was able to make it work without his help.
This project was my first DOM project, it was cool. I liked it. Thank you, hope you are having a great day!
